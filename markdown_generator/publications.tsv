2020-12-17	Mapping and Taking Stock of Personal Informatics Literature	Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies (IMWUT)	The research community on the study and design of systems for personal informatics has grown over the past decade. To take stock of what the topics the field has studied and methods the field has used, we map and label 523 publications from ACM's library, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed. We surface that the literature has focused on studying and designing for health and wellness domains, an emphasis on understanding and overcoming barriers to data collection and reflection, and progressively fewer contributions involving artifacts being made. Our mapping review suggests directions future research could explore, such as identifying and resolving barriers to tracking stages beyond collection and reflection, engaging more with domain experts, and further discussing the privacy and ethical concerns around tracked data.

2018-12-02	Neutralizing BLE Beacon-based Electronic Attendance System using Signal Imitation Attack	IEEE Access	Many emerging location- or proximity-based applications use Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons thanks to the increasing popularity of the technology in mobile systems. An outstanding example is the BLE beacon-based electronic attendance system (BEAS) used in many universities today to increase the efficiency of lectures. Despite its popularity and usefulness, however, BEAS has not been thoroughly analyzed for its potential vulnerabilities. In this paper, we neutralize a university's BEAS by maliciously cheating attendance (i.e., faking attendance while the subject is not physically present at the location) in various scenarios using signal imitation attack, and investigate its possible vulnerabilities. The BEAS exploited in this paper is a commercial system actually used in a well-known university. After the exploitation experiment, we analyze the system's weaknesses and present possible counter-measures. Furthermore, additional attack methods are shown to re-counteract those possible counter-measures and to discuss the fundamental challenges, deficiencies, and suggestions in electronic attendance systems using BLE beacons.

2016-01-01	Immersive Gesture Interface Design for HMD Based Virtual World Navigation	Extended Abstracts of HCI Korea 2016	Increased popularity of head-mounted displays (HMD) highlights the need to design effective interfaces to help the user navigate a 3D virtual world. This study compared four different interfaces: gesture interface that the user imitates bird-like motions, gesture interface that the user imitates a "superman" motion, a set of hand gestures, and traditional keyboard input. Microsoft Kinect's Motion Sensor was used when implementing motion recognizing algorithms, and Oculus Rift DK2 was used to render the 3D virtual world. To compare the four designed interfaces for virtual environments based on Oculus HMD navigation, the four interfaces were evaluated by 31 students Chung-Ang University students. Preliminary findings suggests that bird-like motions were the easiest to navigate. We discuss the pros and cons of different interaction techniques between the virtual reality and the user, and propose a new operation method for traversing 3D virtual worlds.
