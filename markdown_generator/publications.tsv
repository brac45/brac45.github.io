Stroke rehabilitation is critical for stroke survivors to regain independence in their daily activities. Central to this rehabilitation process is patient-centered goal-setting, a crucial philosophy underpinning personalized programs. However, mismatched expectations between stroke survivors and clinicians often lead to limited engagement from patients, which detracts from patient-centeredness. We envision that stroke survivors who engage in journaling activities can empower themselves to be more proactive, thereby enhancing the goal-setting process. To this end, we iteratively designed and developed GoalTrack, an activity journaling app utilizing voice and touch to support stroke survivors in articulating their rehabilitation goals. Using GoalTrack as a probe, we conducted an in-lab user study with thirteen stroke survivor participants. We present findings on how stroke survivors utilize multimodal input for different data formats, and their perspectives on its accessibility. We also report on how stroke survivors envision activity journaling in the goal-setting process, where our findings suggest that journaling supports articulating personalized rehabilitation goals and fosters enhanced engagement with therapists. We also discuss future avenues of research for designing multimodal interfaces for stroke survivors, and share lessons learned from conducting in-lab studies.

We therefore examine how people approach selecting self-tracking apps and investigate how technology can better support the process. Drawing on past literature on how people select and perceive the features of commercial and research tracking tools, we surface seven attributes people consider during selection, and design a low-fidelity prototype of an app store that highlights these attributes. We then conduct semi-structured interviews with 18 participants to further investigate what people consider during selection, how people select self-tracking apps, and how surfacing tracking-related attributes could better support selection. We find that people often prioritize features related to self-tracking during selection, such as approaches to collecting and reflecting on data, and trial apps to determine whether they would suit their needs. Our results also show potential for technology surfacing how apps support tracking to reduce barriers to selection. We discuss future opportunities for improving self-tracking app selection, such as ways to enhance existing self-tracking app distribution platforms to enable people to filter and search apps by desirable features.

fullpapers	2020-12-17	Mapping and Taking Stock of Personal Informatics Literature	Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies (IMWUT)	The research community on the study and design of systems for personal informatics has grown over the past decade. To take stock of what the topics the field has studied and methods the field has used, we map and label 523 publications from ACM's library, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed. We surface that the literature has focused on studying and designing for health and wellness domains, an emphasis on understanding and overcoming barriers to data collection and reflection, and progressively fewer contributions involving artifacts being made. Our mapping review suggests directions future research could explore, such as identifying and resolving barriers to tracking stages beyond collection and reflection, engaging more with domain experts, and further discussing the privacy and ethical concerns around tracked data.

An outstanding example is the BLE beacon-based electronic attendance system (BEAS) used in many universities today to increase the efficiency of lectures. Despite its popularity and usefulness, however, BEAS has not been thoroughly analyzed for its potential vulnerabilities. In this paper, we neutralize a university's BEAS by maliciously cheating attendance (i.e., faking attendance while the subject is not physically present at the location) in various scenarios using signal imitation attack, and investigate its possible vulnerabilities. The BEAS exploited in this paper is a commercial system actually used in a well-known university. After the exploitation experiment, we analyze the system's weaknesses and present possible counter-measures. Furthermore, additional attack methods are shown to re-counteract those possible counter-measures and to discuss the fundamental challenges, deficiencies, and suggestions in electronic attendance systems using BLE beacons.

This study compared four different interfaces: gesture interface that the user imitates bird-like motions, gesture interface that the user imitates a "superman" motion, a set of hand gestures, and traditional keyboard input. Microsoft Kinect's Motion Sensor was used when implementing motion recognizing algorithms, and Oculus Rift DK2 was used to render the 3D virtual world. To compare the four designed interfaces for virtual environments based on Oculus HMD navigation, the four interfaces were evaluated by 31 students Chung-Ang University students. Preliminary findings suggests that bird-like motions were the easiest to navigate. We discuss the pros and cons of different interaction techniques between the virtual reality and the user, and propose a new operation method for traversing 3D virtual worlds.
