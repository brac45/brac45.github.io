excerpt: 'Increased popularity of head-mounted displays (HMD) highlights the need to design effective interfaces to help the user navigate a 3D virtual world. This study compared four different interfaces: gesture interface that the user imitates bird-like motions, gesture interface that the user imitates a &quot;superman&quot; motion, a set of hand gestures, and traditional keyboard input. Microsoft Kinect&apos;s Motion Sensor was used when implementing motion recognizing algorithms, and Oculus Rift DK2 was used to render the 3D virtual world. To compare the four designed interfaces for virtual environments based on Oculus HMD navigation, the four interfaces were evaluated by 31 students Chung-Ang University students. Preliminary findings suggests that bird-like motions were the easiest to navigate. We discuss the pros and cons of different interaction techniques between the virtual reality and the user, and propose a new operation method for traversing 3D virtual worlds. '

Increased popularity of head-mounted displays (HMD) highlights the need to design effective interfaces to help the user navigate a 3D virtual world.

Microsoft Kinect&apos;s Motion Sensor was used when implementing motion recognizing algorithms, and Oculus Rift DK2 was used to render the 3D virtual world.
