I'm a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researcher and software engineer, where I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD). I'm a current member of the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at UMD, and affiliated with the TRACE center. I'm currently advised by Dr. Stephanie Valencia^2, where I research accessible computer-mediated technology for people with aphasia (i.e., people with language disabilities).

My research centers around the concept of agency when people with language disabilities use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) technology. I'm particularly interested in examining how generative AI such as large language models (LLM) are perceived by people with aphasia, and exploring potential for generative AI in supporting people's communication goals. When seeking answers to interesting questions, I like to build software and/or hardware prototypes to test new ideas, and am fond of a mixed-method approach for empirical HCI research. I design and conduct qualitative studies such as design workshops and quantitative research methods such as inferential statistics.

I was fortunate to have worked with Dr. Eun Kyoung Choe and Dr. Ivan Lee in examining how self-tracking tools can support goal-setting in stroke rehabilitation. I've also worked with Dr. Daniel Epstein and the members of the Personal Informatics Everyday (PIE) lab at UC Irvine on various self-tracking technology research.

I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine, and B.S., in Computer Science and Engineering at Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea.

Outside of work, I enjoy running, traveling, and music. I also like making noise with my guitars, and overthinking the meaning of video games.
