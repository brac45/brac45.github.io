I'm a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researcher and software engineer, where I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://ischool.umd.edu/) (UMD). I'm a current member of the [Human-Computer Interaction Lab at UMD](https://hcil.umd.edu/). I'm currently advised by [Dr. Stephanie Valencia^2](https://stephanie-valencia.com/), where I research accessible computer-mediated technology for people with aphasia (i.e., people with language disabilities).

My research centers around the concept of conversational agency when people with language disabilities use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) technology. I'm particularly interested in examining the roles generative AI such as large language models' (LLM) can have in AAC technology, and exploring potential for generative AI in supporting people with language disabilities' communication goals. I like to build software and/or hardware prototypes to test new ideas, and employ user experience (UX) research methods when exploring interesting questions.

I was fortunate to have worked with [Dr. Eun Kyoung Choe](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~choe/) and [Dr. Ivan Lee](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/ahha/team/) in examining how self-tracking tools can support goal-setting in stroke rehabilitation. I've also worked with [Dr. Daniel Epstein](https://depstein.net/) and the members of the [Personal Informatics Everyday (PIE) lab](https://depstein.net/pielab) at UC Irvine on various self-tracking technology research.

I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at the [University of California, Irvine](https://cs.ics.uci.edu/), and B.S., in Computer Science and Engineering at [Chung-Ang University](https://neweng.cau.ac.kr/index.do), Seoul, South Korea.
